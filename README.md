What follows is a small example of my current software stack (v1.0.2). I use a 14-inch MacBook Pro with the Apple M1 Pro SoC, macOS 
Monterey (12.0.1), [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) terminal, [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell, 
[Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) monospace font, and the [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) text editor. I 
also use [Caffeine](https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine) to keep my laptop awake, 
[Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) for doing hourly incremental backups, [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) for creating temporary notes, 
[DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) for collecting, organizing, editing, and annotating data, notes, and documents, 
[Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) for controlling the placement of apps on screen, the [Recents](https://recentsapp.com/) 
recent file tracker, and either the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/), [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/), or [Solarized Light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) 
color themes. ðŸ“« How to reach me: @pmullins on [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).
