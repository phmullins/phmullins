Hello there! Curious what apps I use? I currently (v1.0.1.) maintain two software stacks: personal & work.  
On my **personal** laptop (MacBook Pro) I like to use the latest version of macOS along with [tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby), [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell), 
[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), [hack-font](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), [solarized-light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/),
[recents](https://recentsapp.com/), [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle), and [pastebot](https://www.tapbots.com/pastebot/). 
On my **work** laptop (MacBook Pro) I use [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/),
[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [gruvbox-dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib), [hack-font]((https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)),
[recents](https://recentsapp.com/), [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle), and [pastebot](https://www.tapbots.com/pastebot/).
