In case anyone is interested, I maintain two software stacks (Personal & Professional). On my **personal** machines I like to use the 
latest version of macOS, the [tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby) terminal emulator, [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) as my shell, 
[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) as my text editor, the [hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) mono font, 
the [solarized-light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color scheme, [recents](https://recentsapp.com/) for recalling 
recently used documents, the [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) windows manager, and [pastebot](https://www.tapbots.com/pastebot/) 
as my clipboard manager. The **professional** stack is made up of [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) as the terminal emulator, the [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) shell which is 
enabled by default on newer versions of macOS, [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for text editing, and the 
[gruvbox-dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) color scheme. Additionally, I also use hack, recents, rectangle, and 
pastebot from my personal stack.
