What follows is a small example of my current software stack (v1.0.4). I use a 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple's M1 Pro SoC, macOS 
Monterey 12.4, [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) terminal, [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell, 
[Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) monospace font, and the [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) text editor. I 
also use the [Keeping You Awake](https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake) app to keep my MacBook Pro awake, [1Password](https://1password.com/) for
managing my login passwords and software keys, [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) for controlling the audio on my 
laptop, [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) for doing hourly incremental backups, [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) for creating 
temporary notes, [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) for collecting, organizing, editing, and annotating data, 
notes, and documents, [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) for controlling the placement of apps on screen, the 
[Recents](https://recentsapp.com/) recent file tracker, and either the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/), or 
[Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color themes.
