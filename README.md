Hello there. I'm Patrick, and I'm a writer, gamer, geek, father, and husband. I write, build, game, tinker, and geek out on macOS, AmigaOS, and UNIX.

My hardware (v1.0.4) stack consists of a MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2023) with a M2 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, 12.9" iPad Pro (6th Gen) w/1TB storage and 16GB of RAM, and an Apple Watch Ultra. My software (v1.0.8) stack consists primarily of macOS Ventura 13.4.1 (22F82), iOS 16.5.1, iPadOS 16, WatchOS 9.5.2, [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/), the [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell, [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (It doesn't suck), and the [ox](https://github.com/curlpipe/ox) text editor. I also use the extremely useful [1Password](https://1password.com/) from Agile Bits for managing my passwords, logins, and credentials, the [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) audio manager and equalizer, and the [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) and [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/) backup apps for local and online backups. Finally, I couldn't make it through the day without the [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) notes editor, [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) for managing windows, 
[HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/) for search, and [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) 3 for storing and sorting my [second brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_brain). Update: I recently started using a new app launcher called [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) and it's awesome. 

ðŸ“« Contact Information: Got a question about the stuff I've created? Maybe you want to discuss my software or hardware stacks? Awesome! Please feel free to look me up on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pmullins) (@pmullins).
