Hello there! Curious what apps I use? I currently maintain two software stacks (v1.0.2): personal & work. On my **personal** 
laptop I like to use the latest version of macOS along with the [tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby) terminal, 
[fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell, [bbedit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) editor, 
[hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font, [solarized-light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color scheme, 
[rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) windows manager, [pastebot](https://www.tapbots.com/pastebot/) clipboard
manager, and [recents](https://recentsapp.com/). On my **work** laptop I use the [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) terminal, 
[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) shell, [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor, [gruvbox-dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) 
color scheme, [hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font, [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) windows manager, 
[pastebot](https://www.tapbots.com/pastebot/) clipboard manager, and [recents](https://recentsapp.com/).
