Hello there. I maintain multiple (personal & work) software stacks. My personal stack is made up of [tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby), 
[fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell), [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/),
[hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), and [solarized-light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/). I'm also using [recents](https://recentsapp.com/) to recall recent files 
and [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) as my windows manager. My work stack is [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), 
[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), [gruvbox-dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib), 
[recents](https://recentsapp.com/), and [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle).
