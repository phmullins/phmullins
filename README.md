my default shell, [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) as my multiplexer, [ox](https://github.com/curlpipe/ox) as my text editor, 
[hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) as my typeface font, and [gruvbox-dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib)

I'm also using [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd) as my list command, [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) paired with 
[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for finding stuff, [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for reading files, and
