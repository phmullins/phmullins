My hardware (v1.0.2) stack consists of a MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) with an Apple M1 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad Pro (12.9-inch), 
and an Apple Watch (Series 7). My software (v1.0.6) stack consists primarily of macOS, iOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), 
the [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell, [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (It doesn't suck), and 
the [ox](https://github.com/curlpipe/ox) text editor. Additionally, I also use several small utilities found in the 
[Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/toolbox/) Toolbox, [1Password](https://1password.com/) for managing my passwords and logins, 
the [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) audio manager and equalizer, and the [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) and [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/) backup apps for local and online backups. Finally, I couldn't make it through the day without the [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) notes editor, [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) windows manager, and [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) for storing and managing my [second brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_brain).
