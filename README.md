Hello there. I maintain multiple software stacks that I use for my personal and work machines. My personal software stack is 
made up of [tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby), [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell), [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/),
[hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) as my typeface font, and [solarized-light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) as my 
general color palette. I'm also using [recents](https://recentsapp.com/) to recall recent files and [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) as my 
windows manager. My professional (work) software stack is [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell, [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
as my text editor, [hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) as my typeface font, and [gruvbox-dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) 
as my general color palette. I'm also using [recents](https://recentsapp.com/) to recall recent files and [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) as my 
windows manager.
