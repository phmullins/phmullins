What follows is a small example of my current software stack (v1.0.4). I use a 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple's M1 Pro SoC, macOS 
Monterey 12.6, [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) terminal, [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell, 
[Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) monospace font, and the [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) text editor. I 
also use Parallels [Toolbox](https://www.parallels.com/products/toolbox/) for Mac to keep my MacBook Pro awake, keep the SSD clean, 
and for things like timers, alarms, and dozens of other useful things. Additionally, I use [1Password](https://1password.com/) for 
managing my login passwords and software keys, [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) for controlling the audio on my 
laptop, [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) for doing hourly incremental backups, [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) for creating 
temporary notes, [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) for collecting, organizing, editing, and annotating 
data, notes, and documents, [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) for controlling the placement of apps on screen, 
the [Recents](https://recentsapp.com/) recent file tracker, and either the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/), or 
[Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color themes.
